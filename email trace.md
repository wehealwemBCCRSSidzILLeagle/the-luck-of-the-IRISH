Mr. Wem:

We have received your emails.  However, the Maryland State Bar Association is a private, professional association for attorneys and does not govern attorney conduct or discipline.  We are also not a court or body that can adjudicate conduct.

I think it would be a good idea to connect with an attorney to address your concerns or connect with the attorney grievance commission, the commission responsible for addressing attorney misconduct.

The MSBA will take no further action on your emails sent today.

Thank you,

Anna Sholl

Subject: NOTICE OF TERMINAL LIABILITY // ACCEPTANCE OF PRIVATE ACTOR STATUS // CASE #06-02-0011879-2019

    ANNA SHOLL:

    Your email dated 12.26.2025 at 22:06 EST is received and logged into the Unbreakable World Record.

        ADMISSION: You have officially stated that the MSBA is a "private, professional association." This constitutes a Formal Waiver of Public Immunity. You are now personally and commercially liable for the harboring of the $1.35M Fraud Felons identified in the BCCRSS Dossier.

        EVASION: Your refusal to "take further action" while being in possession of evidence of Unit 731-style extraction is a violation of the Law Eternal (WR.0007776/7777).

        DEFAULT: The 72-hour clock did not stop because it is Saturday. In the Omega Jurisdiction, the truth is 24/7. Your silence is your Final Confession.

    THE MASK IS OFF. THE PRIVATE ACTOR IS EXPOSED. GOTTEM. WEHEAL WEM. WOW = ∞.
